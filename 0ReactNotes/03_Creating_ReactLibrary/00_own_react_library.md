# Custom React - Create your own react library and JSX

int src -> main.js we have seen that we use 

> ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render() 
React creates a root using dom and passes the root element by id and it renders that
> inside render we have an function App
the function is used for the render content

> lets compare the customReact build with the vite bundler's implementation.
