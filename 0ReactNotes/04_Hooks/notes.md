# Why you need hooks 

study things when you need then and why they are being used and how are they being used.

we can use onClick functionality of Js but it only reflects in the console if console log is printed even thoug hthe value is increasing we are not seeing any update in the UI becaouse to do that we require states to update the screen timely/ here the concept of hooks come into the scene. 

In this example we have one counter and its display so its not that bog of a deal but when we have to manage the state of this counter at 1000 places inside the page then react truely shines and that is how it is used to get rid of the phantom problem which it was initially designed or developed to solve.

react handle this but taking the control of the UI from the developer to itself to manage everything. and to this we use the concept of Hooks.

Virtual DOM, Fibre reconcilliation diffing algo

## 🧠 1. **Core Architecture: React Fiber**

React Fiber is the **reconciliation engine** introduced in React 16 and is still foundational in 2025.

* **What it does**: Allows React to break rendering work into units and pause/resume work—enabling features like **concurrent rendering**.
* **How it works**: Maintains a tree structure (Fiber Tree) that mimics the actual DOM and efficiently manages updates.

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Concurrent Rendering (React 18+)**

This is a major shift in React’s internal rendering model.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* **Interruptible rendering**: React can pause work on one component and switch to another (like a loading spinner).
* **Transitions**: Prioritize urgent updates (like input) over low-priority ones (like a full list update).
* **`useTransition()`** hook: Marks a state update as non-urgent.
* **Automatic batching**: Multiple state updates are batched together, even across async boundaries (e.g., promises, setTimeout).

---

## 🌍 3. **React Server Components (RSC)**

React Server Components (RSC) separate client-side and server-side logic.

### 🔹 Benefits:

* Reduce bundle size by keeping logic on the server.
* Load data on the server without extra network requests from the client.
* Server-rendered components can coexist with interactive client components.

### 🔸 Example:

```jsx
// ServerComponent.server.jsx
export default async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

## 🪝 4. **Modern State and Lifecycle: Hooks**

Hooks are still the recommended way to manage state and lifecycle logic.

### 🔹 Common hooks:

* `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`
* `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
* `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue` (for concurrent rendering)
* `useSyncExternalStore` (for libraries to subscribe to external stores)

Hooks encourage **functional programming** and **separation of concerns** by abstracting logic into custom hooks.

---

## 🧱 5. **Component Rendering Lifecycle (2025 View)**

### React handles this through phases:

1. **Render phase**:

   * Create or update the Fiber tree.
   * Call function components and collect side effects.
   * This phase is *pure* and interruptible.
2. **Commit phase**:

   * Apply changes to the real DOM.
   * Run side effects (`useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`).

Concurrent features now allow React to delay the commit phase until the best possible moment.

---

## 🚀 6. **Modern Tooling & Ecosystem**

* **React 18+ features** like `startTransition`, `Suspense for Data Fetching`, and **streaming server rendering** with frameworks like **Next.js App Router**.
* **React DevTools** now show render lanes and performance info.
* **React Compiler (experimental)**: Automatically memoizes components to improve performance without manual `useMemo` or `React.memo`.

---

## 🧪 Example: Concurrent + Server Component

```jsx
'use client'
import { useState, useTransition } from 'react';
import ServerComponent from './ServerComponent.server';

export default function App() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => {
          const value = e.target.value;
          startTransition(() => setQuery(value));
        }}
      />
      {isPending && <p>Loading...</p>}
      <ServerComponent query={query} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## 🧩 7. **Frameworks using Modern React**

* **Next.js (App Router)** uses React Server Components, Suspense, and streaming SSR.
* **Remix** leverages loader functions with server-side data handling.
* **Expo + React Native** also support React 18 features on mobile.
