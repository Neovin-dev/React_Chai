# Password Generator 

we will mostly focus on how copy function work which lets us copy only required field rather than the whole page. and different useStates useEffect, useRef and useCallback 
and also how to optimize the project.

> how methods will run when we start the page.
> how changes to any parameter in passwordgenerator will run it instantly.
> how to do all this in an optimised way.
